I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at McGill University. I specialize in developing ways to use language models to understand political language, especially in international diplomacy. As a secondary interest, I also study global governance of artificial intelligence. Additionally, I have done some advisory work on AI and pedagogy at McGill, and have taught some methodological workshops on how to incorporate language models as a research tool.
