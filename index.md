#title: "Scott Robert Patterson"
---
I recently completed my Ph.D. in Political Science at McGill University. In Fall 2025, I'll be starting a post-doctoral fellowship at the Université de Montréal. I specialize in developing ways to use language models to understand political language, especially in international diplomacy. I also study global AI governance, and I am particularly interested in the intersection of technical and normative standards. Additionally, I have done some advisory work on AI and pedagogy at McGill, and have taught some methodological workshops on how to use language models as a research tool.

  - [State Detection NER Demo](https://patterson-s-state-detector-ner-app-vz4hx4.streamlit.app/) - This is a custom named entity detection (NER) model that can extract mentions of countries from unstructured text. Follow the link to test out the most recent version. 
  - [Occupation Classifier](https://occupationclassifierfinetunegit-tgydnpdgrq3ddjrf5e8plp.streamlit.app/) - A fine-tuned GPT model for classifying occupations using BLS codes. Follow the link to try the most recent version. 
  - [Audio transcription](https://whispertranscriber-ypxjgklxlqn6zbmz6e9w8h.streamlit.app/) - This illustrates how to transcribe audio files for free using the OpenAI whisper model. If working with many files or with large files, this [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10qucU8nBED9LA-aIZ8ViK7yR_4btqEnL?usp=sharing) version works better and allows for free-tier GPU acceleration.
  - [Mistral OCR](https://mistral-ocr-gui.streamlit.app/) This is a simple interface to use the Mistral OCR tool. For more about Mistral OCR, see this [link](https://mistral.ai/fr/news/mistral-ocr)
  - [Dynamic Prompt Developer](https://searchagent-patterson.streamlit.app/). Under development

[Policy](Policy)
At McGill, I contributed to some of the early policy work on the pedagogical impacts of Generative AI.

- [AI Working Group, Teaching and Learning Services](https://www.mcgill.ca/stl/files/stl/stl_recommendations_2.pdf) - I co-authored this policy recommendation as the graduate student representative to this working group. I was mostly interested in clarifying the technical differences between detecting plagiarism and AI-generated content for academic integrity issues.
- [Briefing to the Faculty of Arts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MYb3u-87lDRLgY9kQRfMxMLJLiq-pLSR/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=117443471251182349467&rtpof=true&sd=true) - This is a memo that I wrote to brief the Faculty of Arts on capabilities and future trajectories of generative AI. It discusses capabilities, key actors, and potential pedagogical impacts (from the vantage of March 2023).
