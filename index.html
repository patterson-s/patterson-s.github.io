    <h1>Scott Robert Patterson</h1>
    <p> Welcome to my professional website. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at McGill University. Most of my research is focused on two aspects of generative AI. First, I spend most of my working hours thinking about how language models can be used for social science research. My second research area focuses on the broader societal impacts of AI.  </p>

        <h2>Research on Language Models</h2>
        <p>My dissertation explores the "Linguistic Turn" in International Relations and its implications for the use of large language models (LLMs) as research tools in social sciences.</p>
        <h3>Recent Publications</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/isagsq/ksae023">Domesticating Wealth Inequality</a> - This paper seeks to explain the persistence of wealth inequality between countries of the North and South through the lens of rhetorical “domestication”. Using a corpus of General Assembly annual debates from 1971 to 2018, our machine learning textual analysis reveals how a growing proportion of countries address economic development in an increasingly managerial way.</li>

        <h2>Social and Political Issues of Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <p> I am currently working on a project that examines how the shift to transformer-based language models has affected the political economy of machine translation, especially in the United Nations system. Additionally, I served as the graduate student representative to the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/stl/files/stl/stl_recommendations_2.pdf">McGill Sub-committee on Teaching and Learning's AI working group.</a> </p>
