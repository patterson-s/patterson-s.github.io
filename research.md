### Publications
My research at McGill has focused on how to use language models to understand political language, especially in international diplomacy. So far, I have published two papers with my supervisor, Vincent Pouliot. 

[*"Domesticating Wealth Inequality."*](https://doi.org/10.1093/isagsq/ksae023) Global Studies Quarterly (2024).
- This paper features a discourse analysis of "wealth inequality" in diplomatic debates at the United Nations General Assembly that spans from 1971 - 2018. In the paper, we use a word embedding approach to demonstrate how discourse on wealth inequality has become "domesticated" in assembly debates since the late 1970s. We think about domestication here in two senses - both to tame and to make a domesticate (as opposed to international).
